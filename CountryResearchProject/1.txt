The Miami

The Miami Indians lived in eastern woodlands, however they did not originate there. They originated in an area south of Lake Michigan, where they resided near present Green Bay, Wisconsin, around 1650. During early 1700s they lived near present Fort Wayne, Indiana, where Kekionga, their principal village was located. They gave up their Indiana land by treaties between 1818 and 1840. Forced removal in 1846 caused only half of the tribe staying in Indiana, and around 500 relocated to Kansas. “The Western Miami” agreed to move to northeastern Indian Territory (present Ottawa County, Oklahoma) in 1867.

The early Miami were known for growing unique varieties of white corn. They celebrated harvests and green corn time with feasts. Games played included the moccasin game, the double ball game, and darts.

Their endogamous (could not find a meaning; has something to do with marriage) clans built summer villages of framed long houses, with a separate larger structure used for councils and ceremonies.
